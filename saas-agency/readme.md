# SYNCRA SaaS Landing Page (Dark + Light)

This project contains two matching landing page templates built for a fictional automation studio called **SYNCRA**. The templates are designed to teach layout structure, design systems, theme switching, and responsive front-end development.

You get:

- **Dark version** – cinematic, glassy, neon-accented, Apple-style UI  
- **Light version** – bright, clean, minimal SaaS aesthetic  

Both templates share the **same HTML structure** but use different design tokens, showing how modern UI systems handle theming.
